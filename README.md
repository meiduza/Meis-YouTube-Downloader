# Meis-YouTube-Downloader
 A simple GUI downloader that utilizes YT-DLP and FFmpeg. Mostly for my own purposes, but go nuts.

- Choose between Video or Audio downloads.
- Works on videos, playlists and entire channels.
- Converts to MP3 automatically thanks to FFmpeg
- Metadata Overrides to make tagging easier.

# The app requires:
- .Net Framework 4.5 or later
- Visual 2019 C++ Redistributable
- Windows 10 and up.

# Thanks to much smarter people than myself:
- YT-DLP: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
- FFmpeg: https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html

## Known issues:
- Struggles with longer videos (anything over 15 minutes freezes the app, but does still manage to spit out the correct file).
