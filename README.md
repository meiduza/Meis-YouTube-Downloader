# Meis-YouTube-Downloader
 A simple GUI downloader that utilizes YT-DLP and FFmpeg. Mostly for my own purposes, but go nuts.

- Choose between Video or Audio downloads.
- Works on videos, playlists and entire channels.
- Converts to MP3 automatically thanks to FFmpeg
- Metadata Overrides to make tagging easier.

The app requires .Net Framework 4.5 or later, and the Visual 2019 C++ Redistributable, and was designed to run only on Windows 10 and up.

Thanks to much smarter people than myself:
